# Star Aesthetic Centre — Project State Log
_Last updated: 2026-04-04 (session 5 — major admin panel session)_

---

## Current Phase
**Phase 3 — Backend Migration: Drop WordPress, go Supabase-native** (🔄 Near Complete)

---

## Git Status
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Last commit:** `7c3266b` — "Add Dr. Bangalee page, Contact, Legal pages, Skin Assessment & CTA"
- **Status:** Large amount of uncommitted work — commit before go-live

---

## Dev Server
- **Start command:** `cd "C:\Users\ignat\Local Sites\star-aesthetic-centre\nextjs"` then `npx next dev --port 3001`
- **Note:** `npm run dev:clean` broken — rimraf not installed globally. Always use npx command above.
- **Cache issue:** If 404s appear on treatment/shop pages, run `rmdir /s /q .next` then restart.
