# Star Aesthetic Centre — Project State Log
_Last updated: 2026-07-02 (session 6 — pigmentation content overhaul + treatment page CTA redesign)_

---

## Session 6 (2026-07-02) — Summary

**Git/machine sync fixed:** The DELL laptop's local `nextjs` folder had no `.git` at all (all prior pushes came from the Acer). Wired it to `origin`, hard-reset to match GitHub exactly. Any pre-existing DELL-only work from that session is preserved on local branch `dell-session-backup` (never pushed) — includes an unshipped admin "Products for Your Journey" recommendations editor; re-apply fresh on current code if still wanted.

**Known tooling issue:** `git push` from the command line/automated shell fails on this machine (`fatal: could not read Username... /dev/tty: No such device`) — Git Credential Manager needs an interactive terminal this environment doesn't have. **Push via GitHub Desktop instead** — its own sign-in works fine. `git fetch`/`pull` work fine from the CLI, just not `push`.

**Shipped this session:**
- Pigmentation Treatment page: new hero paragraph, rebuilt "What is it?" section, "How It Works" redesigned as a numbered-circle vertical-line timeline (site-wide component change — applies to all 12 treatments, also fixed proper H3 headings + an `&` entity double-escape bug affecting Pigmentation/Lip Filler/Jaw & Chin), 4 FAQs updated/added
- Glossary: 7 new full-depth entries — Melanin, Melanocytes, Tyrosinase Inhibitor, Wood's Lamp, Tranexamic Acid, Kojic Acid, PRP (glossary now 33 terms total)
- Treatment pages: new full-width bottom CTA (photo + headline + Book/WhatsApp buttons, reusing the product page's bottom-CTA pattern), removed the redundant small navy "Ready to start?" sidebar box
- Lip Filler recommended-product swap (Hydratonic Mist → NeoStrata Bionic Face Cream) — done directly in Supabase
- PayFast confirmed as the payment gateway to pursue (already the documented plan); sent Nakita sign-up instructions + verified current fee schedule

**Commits pushed:** `7ea427b` (timeline redesign + glossary), `a23b196` (bottom CTA + sidebar cleanup)

---

## Current Phase
**Phase 3 — Backend Migration: Drop WordPress, go Supabase-native** (🔄 Near Complete)

---

## Git Status
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Last commit:** `a23b196` — "Add full-width bottom CTA with treatment photo, remove redundant sidebar CTA"
- **Status:** Clean, pushed, deployed to Vercel production, verified live

---

## Dev Server
- **Start command:** `cd "C:\Users\ignat\Local Sites\star-aesthetic-centre\nextjs"` then `npx next dev --port 3001`
- **Note:** `npm run dev:clean` broken — rimraf not installed globally. Always use npx command above.
- **Cache issue:** If 404s appear on treatment/shop pages, run `rmdir /s /q .next` then restart.
